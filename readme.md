# Module Tracker

This is my website for the Advanced Web Programming (CHT2520) module at the University of Huddersfield.

## About the website

The website is built with Laravel and Twitter Bootstrap and is aimed towards university students. You enter your modules and assignments so you can keep track of them and see where you are with your marks currently. You will be able to access predicted marks and see the marks you need to achieve for a certain grade overall.
