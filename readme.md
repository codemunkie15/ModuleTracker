# Module Tracker

This is my website for the Advanced Web Programming (CHT2520) module at the University of Huddersfield.

Link: http://modtrack.codemunkie.com

## About the website

The website is built with Laravel and Twitter Bootstrap and is aimed towards university students. You enter your modules and assignments so you can keep track of them and see where you are with your marks currently. You can also work out your current year mark and your degree classification from the marks you have entered.

## Install Instructions

If you want to host your own copy of the website you just need to host the files on a web server. All the database migrations are up-to-date so you can run an "artisan migrate" to get the structure. You may need the mod_rewrite module enabled if you're on Apache.
